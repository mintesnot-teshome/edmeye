**Ethiopian Calendar (Geez) Age Calculator**  

edmeye is a free, open-source web application that calculates your age in the Ethiopian calendar system (Geez). It provides precise age calculations in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, all based on the unique 13-month Ethiopian calendar. Built with modern web technologies, edmeye is fast, responsive, and easy to use.  

🌍 **Why edmeye?**  
Ethiopia follows its own calendar system, which is distinct from the Gregorian calendar. This tool bridges the gap, offering a culturally relevant solution for Ethiopians and anyone interested in the Geez calendar to accurately calculate ages and track time.
